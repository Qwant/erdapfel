# Internationalization and localization

Translations are managed by `.po` files, via the [transifex platform](https://www.transifex.com/qwant-1/qwant-maps/).

The keys for all the translations are the strings in English.

When a feature branch is merged into master, the new strings are automatically sent on Transifex (using Travis, .tx/push.sh and i18n.sh)

We gather all the new translations from Transifex before releasing the feature on [maps.qwant.com](maps.qwant.com):

* An API Token is required (create one [here](https://www.transifex.com/user/settings/api/))
* Open a terminal
* Run ```tx pull -af```
  * All PO files will be force-pulled, except en-US that is not present on TF but present in the project
  * Enter your API token when asked
  * If "tx" is unknown: run ```sudo apt install transifex-client ```
* To rebuild erdapfel with the new translations: ```npm run build``` and ```npm run i18n```.
* Commit and push the updated PO files


## Poedit configuration

For debug purposes only:

Download and install [poedit](https://poedit.net/download).

Add a new parser in File > Preferences > Parsers > New:

* Language: ```JS```
* List of extensions: ```*.js, *.yml```
* Parser command: ```xgettext --language=Python --force-po -o %o %C %K %F```
* Item in Keyword List: ```-k%k```
* Item in input files list: ```%f```
* Source code charset: ```--from-code=%c```
    
Add another parser, same settings as before except:

* Language: ```PHP```
* List of extensions: ```.ejs```

You can open and edit the PO files in /language/message/, or parse the project to find new untranslated strings
