# Erdapfel

Erdapfel is [Qwant Maps](https://www.qwant.com/maps/) front end application. It is a javascript single page app that allows to browse the map, search for places, see your position on the map, etc

For a global overview of Qwant Maps and more details about each component, check out [QwantMaps](https://github.com/QwantResearch/qwantmaps/) repo.

## Run

### Configuration

As Qwant Maps front end app, Erdapfel relies on a bunch of other services and needs some config to define how to interact with these components.

A default config file is provided [here](https://github.com/QwantResearch/erdapfel/blob/master/config/default_config.yml). You will need to update it to set some services url, for instance:
* the tile server: to display the map
* the geocoder: to search for places
* the place API: to display some details about the places
* the storage app: to store your favorite places

The configuration can be overriden by environment variables.
The nesting is handle by the separator `_` and it must be prefixed by `TILEVIEW_`

For instance:
```
system:
  timeout: 5
```  

is overriden by `TILEVIEW_system_timeout=3`


### Run from sources

You will need

- npm >= 6
- node >= 8

Then you can build and run Erdapfel with the following commands:

```
> npm install
> npm run build
# to build in development mode:
> npm run build -- --mode=development
> npm start
```

### Run with docker

Pull the docker image from `qwantresearch/erdapfel` [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/qwantresearch/erdapfel.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/qwantresearch/erdapfel/)
, set up your config and *voil√†* !

## Develop

* [Project structure](https://github.com/QwantResearch/erdapfel/blob/master/docs/src/project_structure.md)
* [Project internationalisation](https://github.com/QwantResearch/erdapfel/blob/master/docs/src/i18n.md)
* [Code convention](https://github.com/QwantResearch/erdapfel/blob/master/docs/src/code_convention.md)

[![Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/QwantResearch/erdapfel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/QwantResearch/erdapfel)


**hint**: to debug the application from a browser, it is preferable to disable the dynamic loading of javascript files.
When starting the server, add `TILEVIEW_system_evalFiles=false` to your config.

### A note about webfont
The icon font comes from icomoon, the icomoon project is kept in `dev/erdapfel_iconmoon.json` file. You can open it by drag and drop this file on the icomoon web page.

### Test

run `TEST=true npm run build` then `npm run test` to launch all tests.

#### Unit tests
Run unit tests only with `npm run unit-test`


#### Integration tests
Run integration tests only with `npm run integration-test`

It will run chrome headless test suite with a mapbox-gl minimalist mock. The config override is done in the server_start file.

*note on mapbox-gl mock*: We include out mapbox-gl mock fork to emulate mapbox-gl behaviour with the advanced support of mocked event & poi.

**hint** : When you debug or add new tests, you may want to launch puppeteer in non headless mode and keep the browser open.

### Benchmark

`npm run bench ` will build a production bundle and return size and js execution time metrics to compare evolution of application performance along the project life time.


## EntryPoints

#### Style
 ` /style.json  ` gives access to prebuilt style with (optional) language.

A [small script](https://github.com/QwantResearch/map-style-builder) is used behind the scene to build the style of the map and to ease the usage of the icons for the front end. The fonts used for the text displayed on the map are also built using an [OpenMapTiles script](https://github.com/QwantResearch/fonts).

Parameters:

  |method |name |value       |optional |default |
  |-------|-----|------------|---------|--------|
  |get    |lang |en, gb ...  |true     |en      |
